Voice Controlled Humanoid Robot is mainly built to Identify the voice recognizing system in the machines and control the robot using Google assistant through the mobile.
🤖 IoT-Based Humanoid Robot

# Project Overview

This project showcases the design and fabrication of a functional humanoid robot developed as part of our final-year Diploma in Mechatronics Engineering at M.L. Bharatesh Polytechnic, Belagavi (India). The primary goal was to create a human-like robot capable of movement, object manipulation, and basic communication, controlled through IoT technology and simple automation features. The project was designed, built, and tested by a team of nine students under the guidance of Mr. Amey Sir and Mr. Suraj Sir, over a development period of eight months.

# Concept & Objective

The aim of this project was to build a semi-autonomous humanoid robot that can:
Assist humans through IoT-based remote operation
Perform pick-and-place tasks with a robotic hand
Interact verbally through a pre-programmed voice system
Move and navigate using line-following and obstacle-avoidance systems
This robot demonstrates how mechanical design, electronics, and IoT control can be integrated to achieve intelligent human-like behavior at low cost.
